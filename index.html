    <h2>Post Title 1</h2>
    <p>
      This is the text of my first post. Just raw words, no fluff, no filters.
      The internet how it used to be.

    <h2>Post Title 2</h2>
    <p>
      Another post, another rant. This is where I spill my thoughts directly onto the page like a digital diary.

    <h2>Post Title 3</h2>
    <p>
      Here's a third post. You can keep adding these forever. Just copy the h2 and p tags.
