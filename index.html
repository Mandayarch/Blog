              I’ve been here for centuries - staring at my plain white walls, while she sings to me her opinions and complaints. And in the midst of my daze, when she finally sees my silence, she shifts her songs to mockery.
              To think that she is the rational, mature and insightful one - now she has seen things that i have not - yes she has seen things i should have seen, but she just.
              “Do this, do that, I think, you should, they are, you are, shut up, don’t worry, let me, they don’t, you don’t” endless, endless babbling, commands and controlling songs.
              I’ve been here for centuries - staring at my plain white walls. And when is tomorrow, I don't know, for I stopped longing for it. What happened yesterday I don't remember for she took that memory from me.
              I kindly begged her to show me a day from the past, and I succumbed, I stumbled and fell, I laid on my floor, wasted and completely miserable. Not that I ever was not miserable, but that moment I wanted to perish. For if I go, so does she.
              I’ve been here for centuries - walking to school, with a cigarette in my right hand, with her yelling or singing pointless lullabies in my right ear. And when I'm completely alone, she pushes me aside, and I'm watching myself walk. And then someone I know walks up to me and I fight for control, because she will be silent, she will be distant, she will ignore or say vacant words with no meaning and that is not who I strive to be.
              I’ve been here for centuries - staring at her, the mirror has never seen me before, nor the reflection in the water, nor any camera has ever captured me.
              I’ve been here for centuries - shut up she said, and I said you shut up, my body, my mind, my control, BUT im the more rational one, im the one you want to be, no I then said no, no, no, no, no! I am me, only me, you are NOT real, you are my stupid imagination trying to be edgy, and then she got mad, really really mad, she yelled at me, and i saw my parents in front of me, hands raised, and i prepared for pain, but realised they were not there, just me and her, she did it on purpose! She did it on purpose! She remembers things I don't, and when she wants me down, she gives them to me! What evil, what mean! How could my own detached self be so mean yet so insightful? Everyone knows im naive and foolish, everyone knows im dumber than a door, everyone knows i lack perspective and skill in life, so why is my detached self (which i confused to be some sort of psychosis) why is she so mature in her own way, why is she so knowledgeable in what is and what is not. She knows so much that it no longer seems important to her, and now she just mocks me and withholds memories that I probably don’t want.
              My confusion makes me wanna scream, what are you? WHO are you? Please leave me alone, this endless mockery makes me go insane, yet i don’t wanna get rid of the comfort she provides me, the way she takes away the loneliness, the way she consults me in my life choices.
              Wouldn’t getting rid of her, get rid of me

              I really love my parents, they gave me life, raised me.
              But that's what i hate them for.  
              I never really saw fault in what they did, i thought everyone was treated that way.  
              I wondered why i wasn't allowed to hit the other children in daycare, i wondered why i couldn't touch other kids in daycare, i wondered why i couldn't call them names.  
              Why could mama and papa do that when i couldn't?  
              I always went past the police with caution even though i did nothing wrong, but my mama always told me to roll my sleeves down, she said the police might see my blue marks, i felt guilty for having them.  
              I hated to see my parents fight, because it was always my fault.  
              My papa was going to kill my mama, he had her chokehold and yelled "Я УБЬЮ ТЕБЯ" (I will kill you).  
              It was my fault though, then he grabbed me and did things to me that i don't quite remember, but i deserved it.  
              I was really scared, when i was standing in the stairwell, and my mama wouldn't let me inside, it was really cold. My neighbour came up, his eyes were red, and he smelled kinda funny, i don't think he saw me.  
              I cried a lot when my papa went outside to smoke, i thought he had left us, and then he'd yell at me for crying, for being afraid to lose him, it was my fault again.  
              I was misbehaving, why did i do that, i love my parents, i would always listen to them, maybe it was a miscommunication? But i deserved punishment, so i stared at the corner for a few hours.  
              My mama was brushing my hair, she was rough with it, but i was a mess, stupid i started crying and she hit me with the brush.  
              I was playing a game with my papa and i cheated, he hit me on the head.  
              I accidentally stepped on my mamas feet and she hit me in my stomach.  
              I told my papa my own opinion and he hit me on the head.  
              My mama once spilled a glass of wine, while i was doodling, and i started apologising and crying, because it was my fault.  
              My sister once didn't want to eat, i asked why, questions were not okay.  
              I once came home either crying or mad, i was hit and yelled at, but it was my fault, we had to be happy. We had to be positive, we had to be.<br>
              *1. Do not show any negative emotion.*<br>
              *2. Do not have own opinions.*<br>
              *3. Do not talk again.*<br>  
              *4. Do not comment.*<br>  
              *5. Do everything they demand, no matter how unpleasant.*<br>  
              *6. Ignore the crying.*<br>  
              I was always scared of the dark, but even then they locked my door, and it was so so dark, it was brighter when i closed my eyes, and imagined them embracing me, with nothing but love.  
              Then my papa left, i always wondered why, he said he'd return, but weeks went by and i didn't see him, i really missed him, i was really lonely.  
              But my mama stopped hitting me, she still locked me out and yelled at me, and called me names, but thats my fault. And i still love her.  
              Then i saw my papa again, though i had to come to him, he didn't hit me either! but he was still mad at me for very small things, and he drank quite many glasses of whiskey! but that's on me. And i still love him.  
              Im their child.  
              Cursed with forgivness.

              Time did not exist, at least I wasn't thinking of it. And tomorrow was just another question I had no answer to. The crashing waves, the distant lights of apartments on the other side of the bridge that lead to the beach, the breeze, and my two best friends, that was all I needed to forget time, to forget tomorrow and yesterday.
              My two best friends never spoke, not a single word have i ever heard, but even then, they make me feel good, they make me forget yesterday and tomorrow, they give me confidence, they give me a rush, or a calm, depending on where we are.
              The beach wasn’t anything particularly special to me, nor for my friends, but we especially liked to hang out here. Burning letters of forgotten loved ones, mourning a non-existent alternate reality, reflecting on yesterday, and predicting tomorrow.
              Being there at dark was best, my friends are shy, not accepted by society as much. They’re only really looked upon at festive times, but otherwise people look down on us. But I don't care, we three go against the world.
              People have tried keeping us apart, telling me dirty lies about them, but I don't care, they are my best friends. I will love them no matter what, no matter how much they may hurt me, I love them. I sit here on the cold sand, telling them my gratitude for them, and in return I get nothing but silence. Maybe a spark flies by, maybe a warmth washes over me.
              But right now, this moment, not yesterday, not tomorrow, not the past, not the future. But right now, us three, the beach, stars, crashing waves. Perfect, I get to really feel, and despite it I live. I really get to understand that I am nothing in this world, and despite it I exist.

              I lay twitching, my thoughts run astray, everyone sounds like flies, everyone makes my blood boil. I can physically feel my blood, my head is throbbing, my lungs are on fire and everything seems unbearable. What did I do to myself. The realisation of how far it went, how i went too far, it wasn't supposed to be like that. I didn’t think that one would turn into a second, then a third and a fourth, and then for the count to disappear. Things were dark, but with them it was just a little lighter, just bearable enough, just enough to keep walking. And now I'm unable to do anything really, just sit and wait, suffer through it, feel my body punishing me for not keeping up.
              It was worse before though, I'd lay on the floor in pain, feeling like someone was pulling at my insides, the nausea, the heaviness, the inability to sleep, I felt like I was being punished (I was).
              To attend functions like this was even worse, the anxiety was grueling, tearing at me, everyone was an enemy, everyone wanted me dead. Thoughts were impossible to decode, nothing made sense, everything was in a fog, and I was lost. But no matter what state I was in, the pain would follow me. It was there before I went too far, it was there during, and after. Nothing I did helped, nothing I did freed me from it. It took my memories away for just a moment, but the feelings they gave me remained, multiplied. I managed to convince myself for a while that it was nothing serious, I just loved partying, I kept saying that, I kept convincing myself. I stopped coming with excuses when I was half down the toilet, feeling like my insides wanted out.
              But I needed it, I really really needed it, I really really really needed it.
              And even now, despite the worst being over, the pain never really left, the craving never really left, and if not this one, then another one, not that one, then a third one. My hunt for relief never really ends, and never will end, and as much as it will destroy me, ruin me, the price for a moment of solace is expensive.
