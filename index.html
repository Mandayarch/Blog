              I’ve been here for centuries - staring at my plain white walls, while she sings to me her opinions and complaints. And in the midst of my daze, when she finally sees my silence, she shifts her songs to mockery.
              To think that she is the rational, mature and insightful one - now she has seen things that i have not - yes she has seen things i should have seen, but she just.
              “Do this, do that, I think, you should, they are, you are, shut up, don’t worry, let me, they don’t, you don’t” endless, endless babbling, commands and controlling songs.
              I’ve been here for centuries - staring at my plain white walls. And when is tomorrow, I don't know, for I stopped longing for it. What happened yesterday I don't remember for she took that memory from me.
              I kindly begged her to show me a day from the past, and I succumbed, I stumbled and fell, I laid on my floor, wasted and completely miserable. Not that I ever was not miserable, but that moment I wanted to perish. For if I go, so does she.
              I’ve been here for centuries - walking to school, with a cigarette in my right hand, with her yelling or singing pointless lullabies in my right ear. And when I'm completely alone, she pushes me aside, and I'm watching myself walk. And then someone I know walks up to me and I fight for control, because she will be silent, she will be distant, she will ignore or say vacant words with no meaning and that is not who I strive to be.
              I’ve been here for centuries - staring at her, the mirror has never seen me before, nor the reflection in the water, nor any camera has ever captured me.
              I’ve been here for centuries - shut up she said, and I said you shut up, my body, my mind, my control, BUT im the more rational one, im the one you want to be, no I then said no, no, no, no, no! I am me, only me, you are NOT real, you are my stupid imagination trying to be edgy, and then she got mad, really really mad, she yelled at me, and i saw my parents in front of me, hands raised, and i prepared for pain, but realised they were not there, just me and her, she did it on purpose! She did it on purpose! She remembers things I don't, and when she wants me down, she gives them to me! What evil, what mean! How could my own detached self be so mean yet so insightful? Everyone knows im naive and foolish, everyone knows im dumber than a door, everyone knows i lack perspective and skill in life, so why is my detached self (which i confused to be some sort of psychosis) why is she so mature in her own way, why is she so knowledgeable in what is and what is not. She knows so much that it no longer seems important to her, and now she just mocks me and withholds memories that I probably don’t want.
              My confusion makes me wanna scream, what are you? WHO are you? Please leave me alone, this endless mockery makes me go insane, yet i don’t wanna get rid of the comfort she provides me, the way she takes away the loneliness, the way she consults me in my life choices.
              Wouldn’t getting rid of her, get rid of me

              Another post, another rant. This is where I spill my thoughts directly onto the page like a digital diary.
